# Calculator

A simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This is a basic calculator that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It has a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Detailed Explanation

The calculator is built with the following components:

*   **Display:** Shows the input and the result of the calculation.
*   **Buttons:** Include numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), a delete button (DEL), a percentage button (%), and an equals button (=).
